# Self-Care App 🌱✨

A gamified self-care Android application that helps users build healthy daily habits while taking care of their virtual pet 🚀🐾.

# ✨ Features

This app helps users build healthy daily habits in a fun and engaging way. It includes four main daily goals: water, steps, sleep, and focus. Users can set their targets, track their progress, and earn fuel whenever they complete a goal.

With the fuel they collect, users can play a space mini-game, where their virtual pet explores the galaxy, collecting stars and avoiding asteroids.

The app is also customizable. Users can personalize their experience by changing their pet’s name and color, as well as selecting their preferred app language.

To keep users motivated, the app provides progress tracking. By showing daily and overall achievements, it encourages consistency and makes self-care more enjoyable.
